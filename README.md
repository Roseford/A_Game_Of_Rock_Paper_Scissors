# A_Game_Of_Rock_Paper_Scissors
A simple game of rock paper scissors that is played by a computer and the user
The computer uses the choice function to make a random selection
The user is asked to pick an option, if the user picks an invalid option, and error message pops up and they are asked to pick again
If the computer and user picks the same option, it is a tie and the game starts again
Else, paper wraps rock (win)
      scissors cuts paper (win)
      rock smashes scissors (win)
The winner is annouced and the game comes to an end

Writing this code was interesting and enlightening.
